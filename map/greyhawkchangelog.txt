0.7 Greyhawk

To improve the variety of units it is practical to use, unit IPC costs were reduced:
	light infantry: remains 3
	light cavalry: remains 3
	medium infantry: from 5 to 4
	medium cavalry: from 5 to 4
	heavy infantry: from 7 to 5
	heavy cavalry: from 7 to 5
	goblin: from 4 to 3
	halfling: from 4 to 3
	hobgoblin: from 8 to 6
	dwarf: from 8 to 6
	orc: from 10 to 7
	elf: from 10 to 7
	troll: from 14 to 9
	treant: from 14 to 8
	giant: from 16 to 10
	dragon: from 20 to 12
	bowman: from 5 to 4
	fortification: from 15 to 12
	ship: from 12 to 10
	small ship: from 8 to 6

To make player nations more unique production frontiers have been changed.  Before the only difference was that evil nations produced goblins, orcs, etc., and good nations elves, dwarves, etc.  Now there are differences even among allies.  This has necessitated some slight adjustments in the starting units for some players.

Other unit changes include increasing Dragon movement to 8, changing giants so they take two hits, and reducing the attack value of goblins to 2 to prevent overbalance.
